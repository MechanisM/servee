__about__ = """
Servee has a few goals, if Django is opinionated server side python, Servee is opinionated site building and front-end editing.

Servee works best built on Pinax.  You can be picky about which components you want, and it is straightforward to build your own components.

Servee is model-independent, and is designed not to get in the way of the site-building process, but to add a level of functionality and a minimal cost on top of an existing Django or Pinax site.
